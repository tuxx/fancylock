# FancyLock

FancyLock is a visually appealing screen locker for Linux that plays videos or images in the background while locked. It's designed to be both secure and aesthetically pleasing.

## Features

- Play videos or images as lock screen backgrounds
- Support for multiple monitors
- PAM authentication for secure login
- Automatic locking after idle time
- Customizable settings

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- X11 development libraries
- mpv (for video/image playback)
- PAM development libraries

### Installing dependencies

On Debian/Ubuntu systems:

```bash
sudo apt install golang libx11-dev libpam0g-dev mpv
```

On Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S go libx11 pam mpv
```

### Building from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fancylock.git
cd fancylock

# Build the application
go build -o fancylock

# Optional: install system-wide
sudo cp fancylock /usr/local/bin/
```

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

Lock your screen immediately:

```bash
fancylock -l
# or
fancylock --lock
```

Start in idle monitor mode (will lock after idle timeout):

```bash
fancylock
```

### Configuration

FancyLock looks for a configuration file at `~/.config/fancylock/config.json`. If it doesn't exist, a default one will be created.

You can specify a different configuration file using:

```bash
fancylock -c /path/to/config.json
```

### Sample Configuration

```json
{
  "media_dir": "/home/user/Videos",
  "lock_screen": false,
  "supported_extensions": [".mp4", ".mkv", ".mov", ".avi", ".webm"],
  "idle_timeout": 300,
  "pam_service": "system-auth",
  "include_images": true,
  "image_display_time": 30,
  "background_color": "#000000",
  "blur_background": false,
  "media_player_cmd": "mpv"
}
```

### Configuration Options

- `media_dir`: Directory containing videos/images to display while locked
- `lock_screen`: Whether to lock the screen immediately on startup
- `supported_extensions`: File extensions to look for in the media directory
- `idle_timeout`: Time in seconds before auto-locking (when not using -l flag)
- `pam_service`: PAM service name for authentication
- `include_images`: Whether to include images along with videos
- `image_display_time`: How long to display each image in seconds
- `media_player_cmd`: Command to use for playing media (default: mpv)

Note: The configuration also includes `background_color` and `blur_background` options, but these are not currently implemented.

## Current Status

### What's Working

- ‚úÖ X11 screen locking with PAM authentication
- ‚úÖ Multi-monitor support with correct video positioning
- ‚úÖ Video and image playback during lock screen
- ‚úÖ Password entry with visual feedback (dots)
- ‚úÖ Idle monitoring for automatic locking
- ‚úÖ Keyboard and pointer grabbing to prevent bypass

### What Needs Improvement

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling in some edge cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Password entry UI could be more polished
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed password attempt limiting (currently allows unlimited tries)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Video transition effects between media files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory optimization for long-running sessions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Better handling of system sleep/wake events
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-creation of default config file (if none exists)

## Future Implementations

- üöß Password attempt limiting with temporary lockout
- üöß Wayland support
- üöß Configurable UI theme and appearance
- üöß Blurred background option
- üöß More interactive lock screen elements
- üöß Support for additional media players
- üöß Screensaver mode with clock display
- üöß Improved multi-head support (different videos per monitor)
- üöß Systemd integration
- üöß Implementation of background color and blur options
- üöß Auto-generation of default config file
